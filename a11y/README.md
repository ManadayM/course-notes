# Accessibility Notes (In progress)

[Podcast on Accessibility](https://syntax.fm/show/072/accessibility) by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) on [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm) attracted me to explore this avenue of Web Development which is honestly the most neglected aspect by most of the developers.

## Accessibility (a11y)
Web is for all people regardless of their race, gender, software, language, or ability. And hence website, applications badly designed they can create barriers that can exclude people from using the web.

~ Tim Berners-Lee

## How?
- Write good code
- Semantic HTML structure
- `img` tag for images not `background-img`
- Think what is most semantic element for your purpose
- Respect hierarchy of heading tags
- `alt` tag is very important for your `content` images
