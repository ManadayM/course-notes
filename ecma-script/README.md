# ECMA Script

Well, I consider myself as an intermediate JavaScript developer. Although, there are so many cool things yet to be learnt and digested.

## Courses I'll pursue
1. [JavaScript30 by Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/) - 
30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge
2. [The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!](https://udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview)
